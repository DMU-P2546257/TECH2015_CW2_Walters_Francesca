  <p> Max Rive is a professional photographer born in Netherlands. Max passion for
  mountains and landscapes began when he would visit high mountains of Switzerland
  at the age of 5. Max planed a last-minute hike trip is Switzerland and ended up
  in hospital for 3 days, he found his passion for mountings again and returned many
  times. Max other hobbies were motorsport and cycling, but he had little interest
  and motivation for his studies. Max would travel while he was studying and was highly
  motivated by his environment, he missed his deadline for his studies and later drop
  out to travel around the world almost losing his life in an airplane accident to
  the Himalayas of Nepal.Max heard the news when he was in shooting Greenland that he
	won the International Landscape Photographer (IPA) awards in 2017 one of the biggest
	awards in todayâ€™s Landscape Photography. Max ambition is to win the IPA and his dream
	has come true.
  	He believes in hard work and anything is possible.

  <P> The video above of Max Rive of why he become a photographer and the experience
		he had from shooting photos of mountains. He explained when shooting at the same
		locations each time he will have different experience because each experience was
		not the same. At the beginning of his journey, he prefer smaller compact cameras
		but eventually changing to a lot bigger cameras with different lens due to better
		quality images and professionalism. Smartphones have better pixels than smaller
		compact cameras which show how far technology has come. Max Rive has inspired me
		to want to become a more successful photographer myself. When shooting my images
		I have felt simillar experience as Rive about not every shot is the same.
