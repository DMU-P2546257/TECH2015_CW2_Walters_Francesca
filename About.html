    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Francesca Walters born in Derby, England 1995. Currently studying Media Production at De Montford University.
			My passion for photography began from a young age. I got my first camera when I was 15 years old.
			The first shot taken with the camera was nature photography. Living near contrary side in Lincolnshire
			gave advantage of taking beautiful landscapes of nature. I was eager to discover the local area taking
			photo of anything around me. 3 cameras later I took a lot of photos of everything in Lincolnshire.
			Decided to take my camera and take photos around the UK. I published a post card at the Louth Museum
			for people to buy photos cards of Louth.
    </p>

    <p>
			When starting out as a photographer I was inspired by another photographer Max Rive. Max Rive is a Swedish
			landscape photographer who is famous for taking photos of nature and mountains. There were more photographers
			who inspired me to improve and learn different styles but Max Rive was the bigger influence on me.
    </p>
<p>
At my second year at university as given me the knowledge and experience in photography. Producing professional
photos to add in my portfolio. Learning different photography techniques such as composition, lighting, and rule
of thirds to create an interesting and professional photo. Using different equipment with camera lens and lighting.
Experience different photography style from nature to portrait photography.
